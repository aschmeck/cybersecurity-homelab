# Cybersecurity Homelab & Portfolio

## Purpose  
This repository is the framework and record of my work in cybersecurity—an archive of what I’ve built, tested, and broken down to understand more deeply. It represents my transition from study to practice, where theory meets configuration, and documentation is part of the discipline.  

Every project here was designed, configured, and analyzed in isolation, then reassembled into a cohesive environment that mirrors real-world systems. The goal isn’t to make something flawless. It’s to keep refining the process, learning from each iteration, and documenting what changes along the way.

## Introduction  
This portfolio documents the systems I’ve built and the reasoning behind them. It includes homelab deployments, detection engineering work, and governance exercises developed through applied research and personal experimentation. Each file reflects an incremental step in the same direction: stronger systems, clearer documentation, fewer assumptions.  

My approach is practical and layered. Security isn’t theory; it’s architecture, repetition, and verification. These projects illustrate that principle—technical execution backed by structured reasoning.

## Repository Structure  
Each directory reflects a different part of the same system. Together they form the practical and academic foundation of my work in cybersecurity.
