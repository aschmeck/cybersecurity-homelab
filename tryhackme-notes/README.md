# TryHackMe Blue Team Journey

## Overview
This branch documents my progress through TryHackMeâ€™s **Blue Team** learning path, focusing on defensive security, threat detection, and incident response. Through hands-on labs and challenges, Iâ€™ve gained practical experience in securing systems, analyzing threats, and responding to cyber incidents.
