# CompTIA Security+ Study Notes

Welcome to my Security+ study notes! This repository is part of my preparation for the CompTIA Security+ certification (SY0-601), and I'm using it to organize and track my learning as I go through **Professor Messer‚Äôs** free online video series.

While these notes are tailored to my learning style, I hope they might also be helpful to others preparing for the exam or looking for a structured breakdown of key cybersecurity concepts.
