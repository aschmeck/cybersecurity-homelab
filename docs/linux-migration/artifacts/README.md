Debian installer logs exported from `/var/log/installer/`, confirming successful installation and disk setup.

**hash_verification.txt**  
SHA-256 checksum output verifying the authenticity of the Debian 13 ISO.

**dmesg_init.txt**  
First-boot kernel log showing hardware initialization with no driver errors.

**apt_first_run.log**  
Output from the initial `apt update` and `apt full-upgrade -y`, establishing the patched system baseline.
