# Debian 13 Workstation Migration and Hardening

This project documents the complete migration of a daily-driver workstation from Windows 11 to Debian 13, performed with the rigor of an enterprise endpoint-hardening effort. The goal was to build a transparent, secure, reproducible environment suitable for administrative work, development, and cybersecurity research.

The project includes:
- Pre-migration validation and ISO verification  
- Full-disk encryption using LUKS2  
- nftables firewall design with strict deny-by-default policy  
- Removal of conflicting firewall managers

- Lynis and ClamAV auditing  
- Evidence artifacts capturing every major configuration step  

All configuration, rulesets, and logs have been captured as version-controlled artifacts to provide a measurable and auditable security baseline.

## Summary of Accomplishments

- Replaced Windows 11 with a transparent, zero-telemetry Debian 13 environment  
- Implemented LUKS2 full-disk encryption with Secure Boot active  
- Built a hardened nftables firewall with SSH restricted to localhost  
- Removed firewalld to eliminate silent rule collisions  
- Added systemd-based automation for updates, log maintenance, audits, and integrity checks  
- Verified system security using Lynis, ClamAV, sysctl tuning, and packet filtering  
- Documented the full installation, configuration, and hardening pipeline  
- Packaged all evidence into artifacts suitable for review and reproduction

## How to Use This Project

Readers can:
- Review the configuration files to understand how a hardened Debian workstation is constructed  
- Inspect logs and artifacts to validate each step of the migration  
- Reference the maintenance suite as a model for automated, low-overhead host security  
- Use the nftables ruleset as a starting point for workstation or homelab deployments  
- Extend the structure with additional portfolio entries (e.g., GRUB recovery, nftables troubleshooting, automation design)

## Artifact Index

See [`artifacts/README.md`](artifacts/README.md) for:
- Descriptions of each evidence file  
- Instructions on how they were generated  
- Links to the specific logs, rulesets, and systemd units  

---

## Next Steps

This project is part of a broader homelab and systems-hardening initiative. Future portfolio entries include:

- GRUB lockout incident response  
- nftables rule override investigation (firewalld conflict)  
- Expanded maintenance suite automation  
- Virtualization network segmentation project  
- Wazuh integration for host-based telemetry  

Each of these will be documented with the same level of rigor and evidence-based logging.
