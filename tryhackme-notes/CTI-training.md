# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Threat Intelligence: Concepts, Classifications, and Frameworks

As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, I completed two rooms related to **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**‚Äîa critical domain focused on understanding adversaries and defending digital assets through actionable insights. The first room was focused on theory and understanding, while the second had tools and practical exercises.

## üß† From Data to Intelligence
- **Data**: Raw adversary-linked elements (IP addresses, file hashes).
- **Information**: Contextual groupings (e.g., frequency of access to malicious domains).
- **Intelligence**: Correlated insights that uncover adversary patterns and drive defense strategies.

## üéØ CTI‚Äôs Core Objective
To establish a robust defense posture by answering:
- Who is attacking?
- What are their motives and capabilities?
- Which Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) signal their presence?

## üõ∞Ô∏è Intelligence Sources
- **Internal**: Logs, incident reports, training results
- **Community**: Open forums, dark web monitoring
- **External**: Threat feeds (open/commercial), government data, social media, etc.

## üß© Classifications of Threat Intelligence
- **Strategic**: High-level trends influencing business risk
- **Technical**: Detailed IOCs used for baseline detection
- **Tactical**: Adversary TTPs to reinforce controls
- **Operational**: Insights on specific threats and intent

## üîÅ The Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
1. **Direction**: Define business-critical assets and threat models
2. **Collection**: Aggregate data using automated tooling
3. **Processing**: Correlate and format disparate logs and signals
4. **Analysis**: Derive meaning, prioritize actions, support IR
5. **Dissemination**: Tailor intel to technical teams vs. executives
6. **Feedback**: Refine CTI workflows based on stakeholder input

## üß± Standards & Frameworks
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Maps adversarial behavior to TTPs
- **TAXII**: Secure threat intel exchange protocol (push/pull models)
- **STIX**: Language for standardized cyber threat expressions
- **Cyber Kill Chain**: Stages of an attack‚Äîfrom recon to actions on objectives
- **Diamond Model**: Visual method to analyze adversary, victim, infrastructure, and capabilities

## üß∞ Threat Intelligence Tools in Practice

In the second part of my CTI training, I explored hands-on tools used by SOC analysts and threat hunters to investigate and enrich threat data.

### üîç UrlScan.io
A web sandbox that analyzes URLs in real time. It captures screenshots, DOM content, and network requests to detect phishing, malware delivery, and suspicious redirects. In real-world use, analysts can submit suspicious links from phishing emails and inspect behaviors like spoofed login forms or obfuscated JavaScript.

### üß™ Abuse.ch Platforms
A suite of open-source threat intel platforms:
- **Malware Bazaar**: Repository for malware samples, searchable by hash, signature, or YARA rules.
- **Feodo Tracker**: Tracks botnet C2 infrastructure for malware like Dridex, Emotet, and QakBot.
- **SSL Blacklist (SSLBL)**: Identifies malicious SSL certificates and JA3 fingerprints used in encrypted C2 traffic.
- **URLHaus**: Shares URLs used for malware distribution.
- **ThreatFox**: Community-driven IOC sharing platform with exportable feeds for SIEMs and IDS tools.

These platforms are invaluable for enriching alerts, blocking malicious infrastructure, and correlating malware campaigns.

### üì® PhishTool
A phishing analysis platform that extracts metadata from emails and attachments. It integrates OSINT and threat intel to reverse engineer phishing attempts. In a SOC setting, it helps analysts triage user-reported emails, identify spoofed domains, and generate forensic reports.

### üß† Cisco Talos Intelligence
One of the largest commercial threat intel teams. Talos provides:
- IP/domain/file reputation lookups
- Vulnerability advisories with Snort rules
- Global telemetry on malware and spam trends

It's used to enrich alerts, validate IOCs, and understand threat actor infrastructure and behavior.

### üß¨ VirusTotal
A multi-engine malware scanning platform that aggregates results from dozens of antivirus vendors. It also provides behavioral analysis, file relationships, and community insights. It's a go-to tool for verifying file hashes, URLs, and domains during investigations.

## üß™ Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Worm Detection via VirusTotal
I extracted the hash of a suspicious email attachment and submitted it to VirusTotal. The detection alias returned was **"HIDDENEXT/Worm.Gen"**, confirming the file was malicious and likely a generic worm variant.

### Scenario 2: Dridex Malware Identification
Using the same hash-based methodology, I analyzed another email attachment and found it was associated with the **Dridex** malware family‚Äîa known banking Trojan with ties to botnet activity. This reinforced the importance of hash-based triage and threat family attribution.

This room helped me bridge the gap between theory and practice by applying CTI tools to real-world scenarios. It also strengthened my ability to pivot between indicators, enrich alerts, and communicate findings using industry-standard platforms.
